%user login icon

-refactor layout -> mainLayout, homeLayout -> sideBarLayout

? add error message and success message (temp fix just navigate it to login page, and console log the error)

- screen flashing problem (getuser info before everypage not sure is this the problem?)
  %moved getUser refetch logic to navbar (so it onlys re render nav when refetching) and data and login state will be shared by zustand

  %when refresh on profile page, login page shows up for 1 sec due to the reset of isLoggedIn state
  (let isLoggedIn: booleen | undefined, undefined means we haven't known the user login state yet)

  -3 renders for both logout/login(?)

  -what are the dependent variable of layout
  -useState
  -useAnimeList (should we add dependent variable to it?)

-duplication of AnimeCard and AnimeCardInProfile

-add watchList feature
%add + icon for adding anime to watch list
%modal in animeCard maybe better to put in other place for render effiency

api client

-should sperate the client for user and animeList?
-should move the interface to entities folder

others

-for api address in api client in react, need to be refactored using env in production and fixed in development
%for cloudinary config, reset it to env in production

problems
-if no private key setted it still register the user but not returning the token
%temp fixed with checking the private before the app runs
