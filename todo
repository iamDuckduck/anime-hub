backend
-general

% should return the validating error message to frontend when validating failed

- should create a middleware for validating req.body

-user
-if a user deleted, should delete other related db data

%add session feature
%implemented in backend
%frontend needed to be adjust for session feature
%refactor the index ts
%user put request: password should be an optional body param only required when changing password
%add profile_image, banner image link to user model
%changed put api to patch, allow to patch one or more property

cloudinary

% handle profile and banner pic

- problem when user upload image successfully to cloud but failed in saving to database

-should limit the size

-should crop the image

jikan api
-could return null on some property

- userAnimeList
  %should not include createdAt and updateAt when posting

  %add favorite feature in frontend
  ? add error message and success message (temp fix just navigate it to login page, and console log the error)
  %get favorite anime in profile page
  %data still exists after user session passed (we should delete all user data cache ) temp fix by using queryClient.setQueryData
  -anime from jikan has different property name in our database
  -in patching we should check same info posting or not
  -if watchListIds exists extend it to the list
  -when current ep is 12/12 should change the status to Completed
  -should validate the watchListIds in userAnimeList

frontend
%user login icon

-refactor layout -> mainLayout, homeLayout -> sideBarLayout

- screen flashing problem (getuser info before everypage not sure is this the problem?)

  - moved getUser refetch logic to navbar (so it onlys re render nav when refetching) and data and login state will be shared by zustand

  -when refresh on profile page, login page shows up for 1 sec due to the reset of isLoggedIn state
  -3 renders for both logout/login

  -what are the dependent variable of layout
  -useState
  -useAnimeList (should we add dependent variable to it?)

-duplication of AnimeCard and AnimeCardInProfile

-api client
-should sperate the client for user and animeList?
-should move the interface to entities folder

others

-for api address in api client in react, need to be refactored using env in production and fixed in development
%for cloudinary config, reset it to env in production

problems
-if no private key setted it still register the user but not returning the token
%temp fixed with checking the private before the app runs
