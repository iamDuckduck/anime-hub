<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/559cd999-3ba9-45ef-af63-3f91095b92f7)


This web application is designed for anime enthusiasts to explore anime information and manage their own anime lists. Built with modern tools like React, Vite, and Node.js, the project integrates the Jikan API to fetch anime details and provides users with the ability to save anime to their lists, track their progress, and add favorites.

### Key Features:
* Browse and search for anime using the Jikan API
* Create, manage, and track personal anime watchlists
* Save favorite anime and track watching progress
* Secure JWT-based login for user authentication
* Responsive, modern UI built with React and Chakra UI

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The web example is deployed on vercel which you can access directly from here: https://anime-hub-one-chi.vercel.app/
but in case, the deployed version is broken or you want to deploy locally, here is what you can do

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js and npm** (Node Package Manager)


2. **MongoDB**
   * You need MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or a remote server. You can download it from:
     * [Download MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
   * You can also use cloud-based solutions like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

Ensure that MongoDB is running when using the application, either locally or using a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

3. **Cloudinary Account**
   * You need a Cloudinary account to handle image uploads. Sign up at:
     * [Cloudinary Signup](https://cloudinary.com/)
   * After creating your account, go to your **Dashboard** to get your:
     * **Cloud name**
     * **API key**
     * **API secret**

    You will need to set these values as environment variables. To do this:

   - On **Windows**:
     ```sh
     set CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloud_name
     set CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
     set CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
     ```

   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```sh
     export CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloud_name
     export CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
     export CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
     ```
     
### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/iamDuckduck/anime-hub.git
   ```
2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
4. Ensure the following environment variables are set. Use the set command for Windows or export for macOS/Linux. Make sure NODE_ENV is set to development.
   ```sh
   anime_jwtPrivateKey=yourPrivateKey
   NODE_ENV=development
   CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   MONGO_URL=your_mongo_url
   ```
5. Run the backend and frontend:
   ```sh
   # In the server folder
   nodemon

   # In the client folder
   npm run dev
   ```

   * Navigate to the anime detail page, and click the **Add to List** button to include the anime in your list.
   * Your list keeps track of what youâ€™re currently watching, plan to watch, or have completed.

### 3. **Manage Watchlists**
   * You can access your anime list under the **My List** section.
   * Here, you can update the status of anime (e.g., currently watching, completed, etc.), or remove items from the list.
